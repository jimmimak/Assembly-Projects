Project 1 - A MIPS assembly program that takes two integers from the user, subtracts the second from the first, and displays the result using only registers $t0 and $t1.

Project 2 - A MIPS assembly program that calculates the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence. The user provides the number n, and the program displays each Fibonacci number one by one.

Project 3 - Implementation of the Euclidean algorithm in assembly to find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers provided by the user​.

Project 4 - A MIPS assembly program that calculates the first 20 terms of an arithmetic sequence, stores them in an array, and prints them in reverse order. Then, print their sum on the next line with an appropriate message.

Project 5 - Sort a predefined array of integers using the bubble sort algorithm and print the array both before and after sorting using the same code segment​.
